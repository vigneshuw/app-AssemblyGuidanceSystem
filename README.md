# Assembly guidance system for manufacturing industries

The repository contains the code for an app developed as a part of the research work conducted at the Manufacturing Innovation Network Laboratory (MINLab), UW Madison.

The application contains a GUI that can be used to run inference on assembly datasets using SMIRL (State Machine Integrated Recognition and Localization).

The works related to this repository are published in the following journals:

## Running the Application

After cloning the repository

**Step-1**

Install requirements.txt

```py
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Step-2**

``` py
python app.py
```

This should start the GUI interface as shown in Figure
